# Adalab Group Project Sprint 2 - by *All You Need is Code*
This is the repository for our group project in Adalab. This is our second month into coding and our first project using Javascript.

## About the project
This project consists in a digital business card generator for web developers. The design and the back-end were already given, and we made the front-end part. For this, we used HTML, SCSS and Javascript.

## About Us
We are *All You Need is Code*, a group of women studying in Adalab to become front-end developers. We had little to no experience in coding when entering Adalab's program, so making this project means a lot to us.
